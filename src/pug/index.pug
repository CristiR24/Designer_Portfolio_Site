                                        I have been working for the last 3 years in agencies, startups and as a freelancer. I have designed apps, landing pages, websites, for a wide range of clients.

                                        I always start with some research, then dip in to sketching. The next step is wire framing, and after we set up the feel of the product, I move on to the User Interface.

                            I am an fresh thinking designer, starting my journey as a Graphic Designer back in 2014 when I was still in school. Because I enjoy creating working mechanisms, I moved my professional activity to the domain of Web and Mobile Design. I worked with both small and enormous design and development teams, start-ups and local businesses.
